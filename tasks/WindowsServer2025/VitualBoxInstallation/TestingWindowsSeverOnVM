### Install Windows Server 2025
 - Set up was pretty straight foreward once I remembered to create a drive for the Virtual Machine. Easily instaled. The test is using VirtualBox by Oracle. 

### Install Active Directory

#### So far Just installed using this command: 
``` Install-WindowsFeature -name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools ```
 - Folllowing the guide above, I didn't see the need to set up remote servers just yet...
#### I used this commmand here just to install Active Directory. 
> I had to reboot to install it
```Invoke-Command { Install-ADDSDomainController -DomainName contoso.com -Credential (Get-Credential) } -ComputerName ConDC3```
 - I had to reboot before installing. Seems to work after.
